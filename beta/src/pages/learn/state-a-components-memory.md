शीर्षक: "State: एक कौम्पोनॅन्ट की मेमोरी"

<Intro>

किसी क्रिया के परिणामस्वरूप कौम्पोनॅन्ट को अक्सर स्क्रीन पर जो कुछ भी है उसे बदलने की आवश्यकता होती है। फॉर्म में लिखते समय इनपुट फील्ड में बदलाव दिखना चाहिए, नेक्स्ट बटन दबाने से करौसाल ( कई चित्रो का एक ऐसा कंटेनर जिसमे एक वक्त पर एक चित्र ही नजर आऐ ) में दिखने वाला चित्र बदलना चाहिए, प्रोडक्ट पे "खरीदो" इस बटन पे दबाने से वह प्रोडक्ट शॉपिंग कार्ट में आना चाहिए। कौम्पोनॅन्ट को चीजों को "याद रखना" चाहिए: वर्त्तमान में इनपुट की वैल्यू, वर्त्तमान में चित्र, वर्त्तमान में कार्ट की हालात। React में, इस प्रकार की कौम्पोनॅन्ट-विशिष्ट मेमोरी को *State* कहा जाता है।

`handleClick()` इवेंट हैंडलर एक स्थानीय वैरिएबल, `इंडेक्स` को अपडेट कर रहा है। लेकिन दो चीजें उस बदलाव को दिखने से रोकती हैं

1. **स्थानीय वैरिएबल रेंडरर्स के बीच बने नहीं रहते हैं** जब React इस घटक को दूसरी बार प्रस्तुत करता है, यह इसे नए सिरे से प्रस्तुत करता है—यह स्थानीय वैरिएबल में किसी भी परिवर्तन पर विचार नहीं करता है।
2. **स्थानीय वैरिएबल में बदलाव करने से रेंडर ट्रिगर नहीं होंगे.** रिएक्ट को एहसास नहीं होता है कि उसे नए डेटा के साथ कौम्पोनॅन्ट को फिर से प्रस्तुत करने की आवश्यकता है।

किसी कौम्पोनॅन्ट को नए डेटा से अपडेट करने के लिए, दो चीज़ें होनी चाहिए:

1. रेंडरर्स के बीच डेटा को **बनाए रखें**।
2. कौम्पोनॅन्ट को नए डेटा (पुनः प्रतिपादन) के साथ प्रस्तुत करने के लिए React को **प्रेरित करे**।

यह दोनों चीज़े हुक [`useState`](/apis/usestate) की सहायता से की जा सकती है::

1. एक **state वैरिएबल** रेंडरर्स के बीच डेटा को बनाए रखे।
2. एक **state setter function(सेटर-कार्य)** वैरिएबल अद्यतन करने के लिए और कौम्पोनॅन्ट को फिर से प्रस्तुत करने के लिए react को प्रेरित करें।

## एक state वैरिएबल जोड़ना {/*adding-a-state-variable*/}

एक state वैरिएबल जोड़ने के लिए, आयात करे `useState` react मॉड्यूल से, फ़ाइल के शीर्ष पर:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

फिर, इस लाइन को बदलें:

```js
let index = 0;
```

इस लाइन के साथ

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
````

`index` एक state वैरिएबल है और `setIndex` एक सेटर फ़ंक्शन है (सेटर-कार्य).

> यहाँ पर  `[` और `]` सिंटेक्स को [array destructuring (डिस्ट्रक्टरिंग)](/learn/a-javascript-refresher#array-destructuring) कहा जाता हे और यह आपको array की वैल्यू पढ़ने देता है। `useState` द्वारा लौटाया गया array हमेशा सिर्फ दो आइटम्स देता हे। 

इस तरह वे `handleClick()` में एक साथ काम करते हैं :

```js
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

अब "Next" बटन पर क्लिक करने से वर्तमान मूर्तिकला बदल जाती है:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>

### Meet your first Hook {/*meet-your-first-hook*/}

React में , `useState`, साथ ही साथ "`use`," से शुरू होने वाला कोई अन्य प्रत्येक फ़ंक्शन हुक कहा जाता है |

*हुक* विशेष फ़ंक्शन हैं जो केवल react के [रेंडरिंग](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) (which we'll get into in more detail on the next page)  के दौरान उपलब्ध हैं | वे आपको विभिन्न रिएक्ट सुविधाओं में "हुक इन" करने देते हैं।

State उन विशेषताओं में से एक है, लेकिन आप दूसरे हुक से बाद में मिलेंगे.

<Gotcha>

**`use`से शुरू होने वाले हुक फ़ंक्शंस केवल कॉम्पोनेंट्स या [आपके अपने हुक](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) के ऊपरी लेवल में बुलाए जा सकते हे। ** आप हुक को स्थितियों (conditions), लूपों, या अन्य नेस्टेड फ़ंक्शंस के अंदर कॉल नहीं कर सकते। हुक फ़ंक्शंस हैं, लेकिन उनको आपके कॉम्पोनेंट्स की जरूरतों के बारे में बिना शर्त घोषणाएं के जैसे समझिये । जिस प्रकार से आप अपनी फाइल की शुरुआत में मॉडल्स आयात करते हे, उसी प्रकार से आप react के विशेषताओं का उपयोग फाइल के शुरुवात में कर सकते है। 

</Gotcha>

### `useState` का विश्लेषण{/*anatomy-of-usestate*/}

जब आप [`useState`](/apis/usestate) को पुकारते हैं, आप React को बता रहे हैं कि आप चाहते हैं कि यह कौम्पोनॅन्ट कुछ याद रखे:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

इस मामले में, आप चाहते हैं कि React `index` को याद रखे। 

> पारंपरिक तरह से आप इस जोड़ी को ऐसे लिखेंगे : `const [something, setSomething]`. वैसे तो आप जो चाहे वो नाम इसे दे सकते हे, लेकिन पारंपरिक तरीके से लिखने पर, आपका कोड बाकि लोगो को भी आसानी से समझता हे। 

`useState` केवल एक ही आर्गुमेंट लेता है और वह है **आरंभिक वैल्यू** आपके state वेरिएबल का। इस उदाहरण में, `index` की प्रारंभिक वैल्यू है `0` क्युकी `useState(0)` लिखा गया हे. 

Every time your component renders, `useState` gives you an array containing two values:

1. The **state variable** (`index`) with the value you stored.
2. The **state setter function** (`setIndex`) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

Here's how that happens in action:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **Your component renders the first time.** Because you passed `0` to `useState` as the initial value for `index`, it will return `[0, setIndex]`. React remembers `0` is the latest state value.
2. **You update the state.** When a user clicks the button, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`. `index` is `0`, so it's `setIndex(1)`. This tells React to remember `index` is `1` now and triggers another render.
3. **Your component's second render.** React still sees `useState(0)`, but because React *remembers* that you set `index` to `1`, it returns `[1, setIndex]` instead.
4. And so on!

## Giving a component multiple state variables {/*giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables*/}

You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number `index` and a boolean `showMore` that's toggled when you click "Show details":

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next

It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like `index` and `showMore` in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be better to combine them into a single one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it's more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. [Choosing the State Structure](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) has more tips on this.

<DeepDive title="How does React know which state to return?">

You might have noticed that the `useState` call does not receive any information about *which* state variable it refers to. There is no "identifier" that is passed to `useState`, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.

Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks **rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component**. This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above ("only call Hooks at the top level"), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a [linter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) catches most mistakes.

Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to `0` before rendering. Each time you call `useState`, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in [React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e).

This example **doesn't use React** but it gives you an idea of how `useState` works internally:

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// How useState works inside React (simplified).
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // This is not the first render,
    // so the state pair already exists.
    // Return it and prepare for next Hook call.
    currentHookIndex++;
    return pair;
  }

  // This is the first time we're rendering,
  // so create a state pair and store it.
  pair = [initialState, setState];

  function setState(nextState) {
    // When the user requests a state change,
    // put the new value into the pair.
    pair[0] = nextState;
    updateDOM();
  }

  // Store the pair for future renders
  // and prepare for the next Hook call.
  componentHooks[currentHookIndex] = pair;
  currentHookIndex++;
  return pair;
}

function Gallery() {
  // Each useState() call will get the next pair.
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  // This example doesn't use React, so
  // return an output object instead of JSX.
  return {
    onNextClick: handleNextClick,
    onMoreClick: handleMoreClick,
    header: `${sculpture.name} by ${sculpture.artist}`,
    counter: `${index + 1} of ${sculptureList.length}`,
    more: `${showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details`,
    description: showMore ? sculpture.description : null,
    imageSrc: sculpture.url,
    imageAlt: sculpture.alt
  };
}

function updateDOM() {
  // Reset the current Hook index
  // before rendering the component.
  currentHookIndex = 0;
  let output = Gallery();

  // Update the DOM to match the output.
  // This is the part React does for you.
  nextButton.onclick = output.onNextClick;
  header.textContent = output.header;
  moreButton.onclick = output.onMoreClick;
  moreButton.textContent = output.more;
  image.src = output.imageSrc;
  image.alt = output.imageAlt;

You don't have to understand it to use React, but you might find this a helpful mental model.

## State is isolated and private {/*state-is-isolated-and-private*/}

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, **if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

In this example, the `Gallery` component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:

<Sandpack>

```js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}

```

```js Gallery.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

      <h3>

      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}

This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it's "local" to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two `<Gallery />` components, so their state is stored separately.

Also notice how the `Page` component doesn't "know" anything about the `Gallery` state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it**. The parent component can't change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to *remove* state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in [Sharing State Between Components](/learn/sharing-state-between-components).

<Recap>

* Use a state variable when a component needs to "remember" some information between renders.
* State variables are declared by calling the `useState` Hook.
* Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you "hook into" React features like state.
* Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
* The `useState` Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
* You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
* State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

### Complete the gallery {/*complete-the-gallery*/}

When you press "Next" on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.

After fixing the crash, add a "Previous" button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn't crash on the first sculpture.

  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  let hasPrev = index > 0;
  let hasNext = index < sculptureList.length - 1;

  function handlePrevClick() {

    }
  }

  function handleNextClick() {
    if (hasNext) {
      setIndex(index + 1);
    }
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];

Notice how `hasPrev` and `hasNext` are used *both* for the returned JSX and inside the event handlers! This handy pattern works because event handler functions ["close over"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) any variables declared while rendering.

### Fix stuck form inputs {/*fix-stuck-form-inputs*/}

When you type into the input fields, nothing appears. It's like the input values are "stuck" with empty strings. The `value` of the first `<input>` is set to always match the `firstName` variable, and the `value` for the second `<input>` is set to always match the `lastName` variable. This is correct. Both inputs have `onChange` event handlers, which try to update the variables based on the latest user input (`e.target.value`). However, the variables don't seem to "remember" their values between re-renders. Fix this by using state variables instead.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Form() {
  let firstName = '';
  let lastName = '';

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleReset() {
    firstName = '';
    lastName = '';
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

First, import `useState` from React. Then replace `firstName` and `lastName` with state variables declared by calling `useState`. Finally, replace every `firstName = ...` assignment with `setFirstName(...)`, and do the same for `lastName`. Don't forget to update `handleReset` too so that the reset button works.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleReset() {
    setFirstName('');
    setLastName('');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

### Fix a crash {/*fix-a-crash*/}

Here is a small form that is supposed to let the user leave some feedback. When the feedback is submitted, it's supposed to display a thank-you message. However, it crashes with an error message saying "Rendered fewer hooks than expected". Can you spot the mistake and fix it?

<Hint>

Are there any limitations on _where_ Hooks may be called? Does this component break any rules?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component function. Here, the first `isSent` definition follows this rule, but the `message` definition is nested in a condition. Move it out of the condition to fix the issue:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

Remember, Hooks must be called unconditionally and always in the same order!

You could also remove the unnecessary `else` branch to reduce the nesting. However, it's still important that all calls to Hooks happen *before* the first `return`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
      setIsSent(true);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try moving the second `useState` call after the `if` condition and notice how this breaks it again.

In general, these types of mistakes are caught by the [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) linter rule. If you don't see an error when you try the faulty code locally, you need to set it up in your build tooling configuration.

</Solution>

### Remove unnecessary state {/*remove-unnecessary-state*/}

When the button is clicked, this example should ask for the user's name and then display an alert greeting them. You tried to use state to keep the name, but for some reason it always shows "Hello, !".

To fix this code, remove the unnecessary state variable. (We will discuss about [why this didn't work](/learn/troubleshooting-state-updates#setting-state-does-not-update-variables) later.)

Can you explain why this state variable was unnecessary?

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  function handleClick() {
    setName(prompt('What is your name?'));
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Here is a fixed version that uses a regular `name` variable declared in the function that needs it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  function handleClick() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

A state variable is only necessary to keep information between re-renders of a component. Within a single event handler, a regular variable will do fine. Don't introduce state variables when a regular variable works well.

</Solution>
